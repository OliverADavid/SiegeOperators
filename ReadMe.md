## Note
includes/css/style.css and includes/js/global.js are included simply as an unmodified and readable format.  Both of these 
files are minified/uglified and used directly from within the index.html due to their small size.  If you choose to change 
any of the css/js, you will have to manually repeat this process yourself.
